# landing-page-JS
Multi-section landing page 

## Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Purpose of project:
- To understand the virtual DOM and how to dynamically add content to a web page via JavaScript.

## Things I learned: 
- Dynamically built navigation bar
- Differentiated the section actively being viewed
- When user clicks on a navigation item, item smooth scrolls to the appropiate section rather than giving you the default jump
